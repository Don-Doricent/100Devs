    <p>You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. Words are always separated by a single space.<br>

        As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.</p>

        <p>Example (Input --> Output)</p>

        <p>"Hello World" --> "World Hello"</p>
        <p>"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"</p>
